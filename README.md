This is everything about the things I learned in The Odin Project.

**What is The Odin Project?** <br/>
The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects. <br/>
More information can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/about <br/><br/>

**What will be taught?** <br/>
HTML<br/>
CSS<br/>
JavaScript<br/><br/>

**What happens after this?** <br/>
I will likely continue to learn about JavaScript as it is one of the more popular tools used by software developers now. <br/><br/>
